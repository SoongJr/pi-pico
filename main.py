# TODOs:
# - add external bootup LED for when it's in a case
# - try lowering frequency and/or power-saving mode, does WIFI still work?
# - test power consumption, maybe with only two accumulators so it doesn't take ages
# - add audio module and raise alarm if there's a problem
#       (e.g. Temp outside desired range (either environment temp or CPU temp), file system over 90%)
