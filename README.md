This branch of the repository is for implementation of a childrens' media station similar to "Tiger Box".  
It shall use a display (1.3 inch LCD from Waveshare with ST7789 controller) with GUI created by nanogui and MP3 decoder chip for the actual decoding (TBD). Later we might add control via REST API and RFID "dolls".  

For now this is a stub with some experiments.
